I would invent an AI for educational purposes. For example, if you have a math assignment and you don't know how to calculate the result, this AI could help you ONLY by explaining and giving you the procedure for a different problem but dealing with the same thing.It could also keep a record of each user's health and give you mini medical consultations so you know how your health is.Perhaps, over time, if the AI ​​becomes successful, we could release a ring connected to the AI ​​so it can keep a better record of your health. I think it would be useful in everyday life because you could have a medical consultation in a short time.
