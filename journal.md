I would invent an AI for educational purposes. For example, if you have a math assignment and you don't know how to calculate the result, this AI could help you ONLY by explaining and giving you the procedure for a different problem but dealing with the same thing.It could also keep a record of each user's health and give you mini medical consultations so you know how your health is.Perhaps, over time, if the AI ​​becomes successful, we could release a ring connected to the AI ​​so it can keep a better record of your health. I think it would be useful in everyday life because you could have a medical consultation in a short time.

The idea is that technology is not a prohibition, but rather a tool that we learn to use responsibly, just as we learn to use other tools in life. During class, we will ask that cell phones be put away so that we can all focus on the class and the work we are doing. However, there will be specific times to use them, teaching us to connect both in the real world. Chromebooks and artificial intelligence, including tools like ChatGPT, will be a resource to help students' curiosity grow, helping them research, create projects, and refine their ideas. With teacher guidance, we will explore how to use these tools ethically, understanding that technology is there to enhance our thinking, not replace it. Online entertainment games will not be part of the school schedule, but we will make space for educational games, which are an entertaining way to learn, preparing them for a future where technology and the human side of life work hand in hand.                        This rule helps in school because this is the future they will eventually occupy in order to progress in the world of technology.

The topic I asked him to do was about the water cycle. Since it was a basic topic, there were no problems. The project looks very good, it has images, and is eye-catching. The only thing I could do is observe the entire presentation and, if there are words that are not understood, correct them and make it more understandable.

If the SNAP program were to run out of funding, many families would face serious food insecurity, impacting their health and well-being, those most affected would be low-income families, families with children, and seniors who rely on this assistance to survive. Technology could mitigate this problem through apps that connect people with nearby food banks and provide information about free food programs, centralized platform would facilitate food donations and streamline delivery logistics; challenges such as the digital divide and a lack of technological skills could limit access to these solutions, if I could design such a tool,  would create an app called "Food Network," which would not only locate resources but also allow users to share recipes and donate easily; this would help connect those who need help with those who can offer it, creating a supportive community.

No, not really, because I'll have to work. The only thing that excites me is the day because we'll cook something delicious that night.

Drones have become an incredibly useful part of our daily lives, think of the Amazon deliveries we see everywhere. Companies use them for everything: taking incredible photos, mapping land, even in agriculture, etc.In the agricultural sector, for example, there's the role of Agricultural Drone Pilothese: specialists use drones with specialized technology to make farming more efficient and environmentally friendly. Programmers create or adjust the software so the drones can fly autonomously, analyze crop health (whether they need water), and apply treatments precisely where needed, saving resources.I found that in Texas, the average salary for drone pilots ranges from $60,000 to $80,000 per year, they usually require an FAA license.

There are cases where someone might not have seen it by accident, but that's ridiculous because it's large, and when driving, you should be focused to avoid any accidents. Even if that were the case, we must always remember that it's important to respect traffic signs, especially those for a school bus. Putting myself in the shoes of a Waymo programmer, I would program the cameras to issue a fine instantly, and after a certain number of fines, have the driver's license revoked and, of course, affect their driving record.  Of course, there might be cases where the license plate is blurry, covered, or, in the worst-case scenario, missing. In those circumstances, the AI ​​could be programmed to try to identify the vehicle, and the police could then stop the driver, as they could cause accidents involving students or simply crash.

Hmmm I dont know, Most likely I'll be resting, and maybe working a few days. I'm really excited because my grandparents and my aunts and uncles are coming to spend Christmas and New Year's with us.
